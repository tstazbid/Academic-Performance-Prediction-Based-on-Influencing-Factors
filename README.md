# Academic-Performance-Prediction-Based-on-Influencing-Factors

This project combines the power of PySpark for scalable data processing and machine learning model training with Flask for creating a user-friendly web interface. The machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient-Boosted Trees, are trained on student academic data to predict performance outcomes. Users can input student information through the web form, and the application provides predictions on academic performance.


**Features:**
- PySpark for efficient data processing and scalable model training.
- Flask for building an intuitive and responsive web interface.
- Trained models include Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient-Boosted Trees.
- User-friendly web form simplifies the process of inputting student information.
- Real-time predictions enhance user experience.

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the PySpark script to process and train the models.
3. Start the Flask web application for interacting with the models.
4. Input student information through the web form and receive academic performance predictions.

**Note:**
Ensure that necessary dependencies are installed, and the Flask application is run in a suitable environment.
